- This is the original summary broken down by school.![This is an image](https://github.com/DanielBergan/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/original_per_school_summary.png)
- In this instance the removal of the data indicated that Thomas High School's scores as well as passing   percentages were lower than previously factored.![This is an image](https://github.com/DanielBergan/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/cleaned_per_school_summary.png)
